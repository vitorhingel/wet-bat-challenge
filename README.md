# Wet Bat Travel Challenge

This project is a challenge where I had to follow certain guidelines to build a fake travelling agency (no auth needed).

## Description of the situation:

Wet Bat creates around 200 quotes a day and provides in average 75 tours per month.

Currently they have a portfolio of 10,000 clients and revenue of $5,000,000 yearly.

One of the main FY2020 strategic actions is to implement an easy to use back-office solution that allows their staff to:

- Create and manage quotes
- Convert quotes into “services”
- Manage the programs (tours)
- Manage invoices
- View key business info

Requirements:

### Database

- Relational database (SQL)
- Include a method to create the database schema, ideally using migrations

### Frontend

- React frontend
- Use a UI component framework that you're familiar with
- UI does not need to match the design document precisely
- We expect a minimal page layout, but don't worry about making it perfect or fully
  functional
- Any method of data fetching can be used (eg. REST, GraphQL, JSON API, etc)

### Version control

- Code to be committed on GitHub
- All application layers included in a single repository
